<h1 style="text-align: center;">The International Workshop on Generative Artificial Intelligence in Education (GAIE 2024)</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">Affiliated to:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">International Conference on Web-Based Learning 2024 (ICWL 2024)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">International Symposium on Emerging Technologies for Education 2024 (SETE 2024)</p>
<br>
<p>Generative AI (GAI) technologies, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) and large language models (LLMs), are revolutionizing education by providing learners and educators a more innovative, flexible and personalized education environment to enhance teaching and learning experiences. With the exponential growth of online learning platforms and digital content, educators encounter the challenges of utilizing such extensive education resource and recommending tailored materials to individual learners. Demonstrating effectiveness in natural language generation and creative design, GAI models are garnering significant interest and demand, particularly for assisting in personalized tutoring, content creation, and developing virtual learning environments. The incorporation of GAI technologies enhances education by making it more engaging, accessible, and tailored to the specific needs of individual learners, as well as dismantling language barriers. As such, this workshop aims to group researchers interested in GAI applications across all aspects of technology-enhanced education, facilitating communication among educators, linguistic experts, data specialists and AI researchers. We hope that applying GAI in education can enhance the learning experience, leading towards greater effectiveness, efficiency and personalized in learning. The International Workshop on Generative Artificial Intelligence in Education (GAIE) aims to provide a platform for researchers in exchanging the most recent achievements of theories, datasets, methods, metrics, applications, etc. for the development of the interdisciplinary area.</p>

  <p><strong>Paper Submission</strong></p>
  <p>All submissions must be in PDF format. Authors should avoid the use of non-English fonts to avoid problems with printing and viewing the submissions. All accepted papers MUST follow strictly the instructions for LNCS Authors. Springer's LNCS site offers style files and information. Formats for the submissions are either Long Paper (12-15 pages) or Short Paper (6-11 pages), including main content and references. Extra pages will have a cost of 100 AUD to Springer during publication.
<br>
Submissions MUST not have been published previously and must not be under review for publication while being considered for GAIE. This applies also to papers with significantly overlapping contributions. Authors are advised to interpret these limitations strictly and to contact the workshop chairs in case of doubt.
<br>
Submissions MUST follow LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) format. We encourage authors to cite related work comprehensively, and when citing conference papers please also consider to cite their extended journal versions if applicable.
<br>
Each accepted paper must be accompanied by at least one full registration regardless of the status of the registering author. Otherwise, the paper will be removed from the proceedings and LNCS digital library.
